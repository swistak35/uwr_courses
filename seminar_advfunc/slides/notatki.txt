PHANTOM TYPES

This looks strange since at first it seems the type parameter is unused and could be anything, without affecting the value inside. Indeed, one can write:

changeType :: FormData a -> FormData b
changeType (FormData str) = FormData str

to change it from any type to any other. However, if the constructor is not exported then users of the library that defined
FormData
can't define functions like the above, so the type parameter can only be set or changed by library functions. So we might do:

data Validated
data Unvalidated
 
-- since we don't export the constructor itself,
-- users with a String can only create Unvalidated values
formData :: String -> FormData Unvalidated
formData str = FormData str
 
-- Nothing if the data doesn't validate
validate :: FormData Unvalidated -> Maybe (FormData Validated)
validate (FormData str) = ...
 
-- can only be fed the result of a call to validate!
useData :: FormData Validated -> IO ()
useData (FormData str) = ...

The beauty of this is that we can define functions that work on all kinds of
FormData
, but still can't turn unvalidated data into validated data:

-- the library exports this
liftStringFn :: (String -> String) -> FormData a -> FormData a
liftStringFn fn (FormData str) = FormData (fn str)
 
-- the validation state is the *same* in the return type and the argument



EXISTENTIAL TYPES

Workers:

-- it's impossible for function to \textbf{demand} specific Buffer
So user can't write function which works ONLY for MemoryBuffer

-- you're more limited in what you can do with Worker like that
So you always has to assume that this is "some buffer", and the only things you can do with it are functions declared in Buffer class
(or functions which work for any datatype, for example "id")

* Mention "OOP" dynamic dispatch
