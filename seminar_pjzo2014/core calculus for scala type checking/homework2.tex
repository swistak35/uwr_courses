\section{Programming variant}
Try to make a static analysis program for Featherweight Scala (with basic features like finding dead code, unused variables and so on). Of course in any functional and reasonable language.

\section{Theoretical variant}
Formulate CBV semantics and extend FS with mutable state (in pdf format).
I am not sure, how hard this task is. It may be very easy or not.
I am accepting solutions for this task for 5.0 grade, even if these are not complete, however you have to show me what you achieved and explain me where you got stuck.
